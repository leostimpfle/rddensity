\description{
\code{rdplotdensity} constructs density plots. It is based on the
  local polynomial density estimator proposed in Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma (2020, 2023).
  A companion \code{Stata} package is described in Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma (2018).

Companion command: \code{\link{rddensity}} for manipulation (density discontinuity) testing.

Related Stata and R packages useful for inference in regression discontinuity (RD)
  designs are described in the website: \url{https://rdpackages.github.io/}.

\details{
Bias correction is only used for the construction of confidence intervals/bands, but not for point
estimation. The point estimates, denoted by \code{f_p}, are constructed using local polynomial estimates of order
\code{p}, while the centering of the confidence intervals/bands, denoted by \code{f_q}, are constructed using local
polynomial estimates of order \code{q}. The confidence intervals/bands take the form:
\code{[f_q - cv * SE(f_q) , f_q + cv * SE(f_q)]}, where \code{cv} denotes the appropriate critical value and
\code{SE(f_q)} denotes a standard error estimate
for the centering of the confidence interval/band. As a result, the confidence intervals/bands may not be
centered at the point estimates because they have been bias-corrected. Setting \code{q} and \code{p} to be equal
results on centered at the point estimate confidence intervals/bands, but requires undersmoothing for valid
inference (i.e., (I)MSE-optimal bandwdith for the density point estimator cannot be used).  Hence the bandwidth
would need to be specified manually when \code{q=p}, and the point estimates will not be (I)MSE optimal. See
Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma (2022, 2023) for details, and also Calonico, Cattaneo, and Farrell (2018, 2022) for
robust bias correction methods.

Sometimes the density point estimates may lie outside of the confidence intervals/bands, which can happen if
the underlying distribution exhibits high curvature at some evaluation point(s).  One possible solution in this
case is to increase the polynomial order \code{p} or to employ a smaller bandwidth.

\examples{
# Generate a random sample with a density discontinuity at 0
set.seed(42)
x <- rnorm(2000, mean = -0.5)
x[x > 0] <- x[x > 0] * 2

# Estimation
rdd <- rddensity(X = x)
summary(rdd)

# Density plot (from -2 to 2 with 25 evaluation points at each side)
plot1 <- rdplotdensity(rdd, x, plotRange = c(-2, 2), plotN = 25)

# Plotting a uniform confidence band
set.seed(42) # fix the seed for simulating critical values
plot3 <- rdplotdensity(rdd, x, plotRange = c(-2, 2), plotN = 25, CIuniform = TRUE)
